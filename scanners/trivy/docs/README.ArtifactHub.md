## What is OWASP secureCodeBox?

<p align="center">
  <img alt="secureCodeBox Logo" src="https://docs.securecodebox.io/img/Logo_Color.svg" width="250px">
</p>

_[OWASP secureCodeBox][scb-github]_ is an automated and scalable open source solution that can be used to integrate various *security vulnerability scanners* with a simple and lightweight interface. The _secureCodeBox_ mission is to support *DevSecOps* Teams to make it easy to automate security vulnerability testing in different scenarios.

With the _secureCodeBox_ we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.

The secureCodeBox project is running on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). To install it you need [Helm](https://helm.sh), a package manager for Kubernetes. It is also possible to start the different integrated security vulnerability scanners based on a docker infrastructure.

### Quickstart with secureCodeBox on kubernetes

You can find resources to help you get started on our [documentation website](https://docs.securecodebox.io) including instruction on how to [install the secureCodeBox project](https://docs.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation) and guides to help you [run your first scans](https://docs.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/first-scans) with it.

## What is Trivy?

`Trivy` (`tri` pronounced like **tri**gger, `vy` pronounced like en**vy**) is a simple and comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts.
A software vulnerability is a glitch, flaw, or weakness present in the software or in an Operating System.
`Trivy` detects vulnerabilities of OS packages (Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, etc.) and application dependencies (Bundler, Composer, npm, yarn, etc.).
`Trivy` is easy to use. Just install the binary, and you're ready to scan. All you need to do for scanning is to specify a target such as an image name of the container.

To learn more about the Trivy scanner itself visit on [Trivy's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy).

## Deployment
The trivy `scanType` can be deployed via helm:

```bash
# Install HelmChart (use -n to configure another namespace)
helm upgrade --install trivy secureCodeBox/trivy
```

## Scanner Configuration

The following security scan configuration example are based on the [Trivy Documentation], please take a look at the original documentation for more configuration examples.

- Filter the vulnerabilities by severities `trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL ruby:2.4.0`
- Filter the vulnerabilities by type (`os` or `library`) `trivy image --vuln-type os ruby:2.4.0`
- Skip update of vulnerability DB: `trivy image --skip-update python:3.4-alpine3.9`
- Ignore unfixed vulnerabilities:`trivy image --ignore-unfixed ruby:2.4.0` By default, Trivy also detects unpatched/unfixed vulnerabilities. This means you can't fix these vulnerabilities even if you update all packages. If you would like to ignore them, use the `--ignore-unfixed` option.

## Requirements

Kubernetes: `>=v1.11.0-0`

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| image.repository | string | `"docker.io/aquasec/trivy"` | Container Image to run the scan |
| image.tag | string | `nil` | defaults to the charts appVersion |

| parserImage.repository | string | `"docker.io/securecodebox/parser-trivy"` | Parser image repository |
| parserImage.tag | string | defaults to the charts version | Parser image tag |
| scannerJob.backoffLimit | int | 3 | There are situations where you want to fail a scan Job after some amount of retries due to a logical error in configuration etc. To do so, set backoffLimit to specify the number of retries before considering a scan Job as failed. (see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#pod-backoff-failure-policy) |
| scannerJob.env | list | `[]` | Optional environment variables mapped into each scanJob (see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-environment-variable-container/) |

| scannerJob.extraVolumeMounts | list | `[]` | Optional VolumeMounts mapped into each scanJob (see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) |
| scannerJob.extraVolumes | list | `[]` | Optional Volumes mapped into each scanJob (see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) |
| scannerJob.resources | object | `{}` | CPU/memory resource requests/limits (see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/, https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/) |
| scannerJob.securityContext | object | `{}` | Optional securityContext set on scanner container (see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) |
| scannerJob.ttlSecondsAfterFinished | string | `nil` | seconds after which the kubernetes job for the scanner will be deleted. Requires the Kubernetes TTLAfterFinished controller: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/ttlafterfinished/ |
